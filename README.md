# GEOG458 Group-14 Project

## Project Overview
// Will remove later

Our group is looking to create an interactive web map that visualizes the environmental conditions and movement patterns in Seattle using the high-traffic road networks alongside pollution exposure on the surrounding greenery. The idea was brought to us due to the reputation of Washington being known for its natural and green environment, yet urban transportation systems may be a driving cause in localized pollution exposure. The purpose of this project is to examine the spatial relationship between road movement intensity and the environmental conditions across Seattle neighborhoods (pollution) using the web-based mapping tools we've learned.

## Dataset
👉 *[Traffic Study Flow Counts](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::traffic-study-flow-counts/about)*

👉 *[2022 Traffic Flow Counts](https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::2022-traffic-flow-counts/about)*

## Target Audience
The target audience in this project will ideally be students, researchers, and the general public who are interested in the conditions in Seattle's traffic scene. Policy planners and government officials may benefit from this type of content, but the aforementioned will likely find themselves aligned with this project more so than the latter.
